### Three challenges in achieving effective email communication

Using only basic configuration to send your emails can lead to:

- Your emails likely appearing poorly formatted in some email clients or not displaying at all in certain cases due to security reasons.
- Lack of tracking and visibility means you might be unaware of how your campaigns are actually performing. Or worse, a declining reputation eventually leading to being blocked by Amazon SES from sending more emails.
- Your emails possibly landing in some of your users' spam folders.
In this capstone project, you will help AWSomeNewsletter optimize their email campaigns by addressing various real-world challenges using the concepts you've learned throughout the workshop. The scenarios presented below are interconnected, culminating in an effective and comprehensive email management solution for AWSomeNewsletter. These three scenarios should give you in-depth knowledge about Amazon SES and help you to overcome the three challenges mentioned above.


### Scenario 1: Analyzing Metrics for "Weekly Deals" and "Daily Updates" Campaigns
To better understand the performance of their campaigns, AWSomeNewsletter wants to compare the metrics for the "Weekly Deals" and "Monthly Updates" campaigns. Create and tag configuration sets for each campaign, then query and analyze the individual configuration set metrics to identify any differences in their performance.

### Scenario 2: Diagnosing and Fixing Issues with the "Weekly Deals" Email Template
AWSomeNewsletter has launched a new "Weekly Deals" campaign, but the marketing teams are complaining that the email content is not rendering correctly. Your task is to diagnose the issue with the email template and fix it to ensure subscribers can view the deals without any issues. Optimizing your content is the first step to ensuring that your content is highly deliverable.

### Scenario 3: Optimize Your "Weekly Deals" and "Daily Updates" emails for Deliverability
Now that you have set up metric trackings and diagnosed the problem of your email campaign templates, time to send your emails out into the world. For this scenario, we will guide you on how to optimize your email deliverability and some of the best practices to achieve high deliverability.

### Scenario 4: Building and Segmenting Your Lists for sending "Weekly Deals" and "Daily Updates" Campaigns

This scenario will cover how to maintain a good email reputation with email service providers (ESPs) by ensuring that intended recipients actually open their emails. As part of this lab you will learn about relevant documentations on email deliverability, and how to use SES Event Processing to evaluate your subscriber engagement rate. After tracking engagement, the scenario will alsocover follow-up strategies, including determining sending frequency, segmenting the email list based on engagement activity, prioritizing active and semi-active subscribers, and reconfirming interest of low engagement subscribers.

Upon completing these scenarios, you will have helped AWSomeNewsletter optimize their email campaigns and implement an effective email management solution using Amazon SES. Good luck!
